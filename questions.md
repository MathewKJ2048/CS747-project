# Questoins related to the project proposal


## Decription

- model labelled transition systems
- prove theorems about safety and liveness of system
- specific system to be studied is courier

- modelled as: states, transitions
- variables take values in states
- each transition is associated with an action, which changes a variable state
- transitions are taken if a guard is valid, which is written in terms of states

- model-checking proves properties for k entities, for  aspecific value of k
- goal is to prove things for n states
- states is countably infinite


## Possibility

- using constructive logic, is it possible to define reachabilibty of a state
- making assumptions about model to help prove things

## How-to

- Use of inductive invariant
- II is a subset of reachable states for proving liveness
- II is a superset of reachable states for proving safety

## Alternate project ideas:

- if rodmap for earlier project is not clear, is switching allowed
- idea: proving correctness of RSA cryptosystem using Peano arithmetic, i.e. proving that e(d(m)) = m for all m
- related problem idea: encoding proof of the two-generals problem in roq
