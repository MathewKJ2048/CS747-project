By February 14, submit a project proposal to Marmoset. The proposal should include the following information:

    A short paragraph on the core vision or key idea of your system.
    A short list of the functionalities you intend to formalize and the properties you intend to prove.
    A more detailed description of the project. Go into enough detail that your peers in the class can more or less understand what you are doing just from the proposal.
    A roadmap of how you plan to execute the project. Sketch out work items. Structure your project as a list of milestones and give time estimates.

This will probably take two pages (excluding references).
